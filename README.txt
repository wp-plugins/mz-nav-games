MZ Nav Games is designed for development of plugins that need to navigate through a calendar.


== Description ==

MZ Nav Games is designed for development of plugins that need to navigate through a calendar. Such that transitions from year to year are fluid and code is abstracted a bit, hopefully.

This is really primitive and an experienced php programmer might wonder, “why bother?”. But for others who are woking on date navigation techniques, it may be useful.

== Installation ==

Steps to install and configure MZ Nav Games:

1. Upload the directory, `mz_nav_games` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In the WP Admin panel, potentially go to: Settings -> MZ Nav Games and configure settings
